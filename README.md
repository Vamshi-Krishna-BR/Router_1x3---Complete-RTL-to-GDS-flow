# Router_1x3---Complete-RTL-to-GDS-flow
This project implements a packet-based 1×3 router in Verilog that routes incoming packets to one of three output ports based on header information. The design supports packetized data transfer with proper flow control, buffering, and error detection, and is implemented through a complete RTL-to-GDSII physical design flow.
